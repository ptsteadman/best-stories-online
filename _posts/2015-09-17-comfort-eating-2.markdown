Amethyst Amelia Kelly, better known by her stage name Iggy Azalea, has announced plans to spend an entire week in a KFC eating fried chicken wings after being dumped by her
manager, rapper and music mogul T.I., because she ‘needs time to think’.

The disgraced rapper, 25, from Sydney, Australia, plans to visit the fast food chain in
search of some comfort food to get over the stress of being publicly shunned by her former mentor.

Azalea intends to order chicken wings with a side of
extra large fries at the KFC near a train station by her home for at least the next seven days.

She has canceled all upcoming engagements this week in order to stay at the restaurant. 

Azalea said: ‘I’ve been walking around feeling miserable, so I decided to stop off at
the KFC at the train station.

'I originally didn’t plan on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings.

'But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.’

This is not Azalea’s first experience burying her sorrows in fried chicken. Employees at the location she has selected recall a similar stay as recently as July.

Worker Rodney Benson, 22, said of the past incident: 'At first no one really noticed her.

'But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar.

'Then I realised we had been serving her for the past three days and that she
hadn’t actually left.

'When we asked her if she was ok, she said she was and just needed time to
think.

'And then asked for another box of chicken wings with extra large fries.’

He said the Azalea was doing no harm eating her way through boxes of chicken so
they let her stay.

He added: 'She was after all a paying customer, even if a bit of an odd one.'

Azalea decided she had had enough when local media turned up after a week at
the KFC. And, unsurprisingly, she was starting to get sick of the taste of
chicken. 

'I decided the best thing to do would be to leave the city and go back to my
parents.

Yet Azalea plans to repeat this bizarre behavior following her latest setback. Workers at the KFC are, somewhat surprisingly, expressed excitement upon learning of her imminent return.

Waitress Donna Jimenez said: 'I guess we kind of missed her. She certainly makes work more interesting.'

This will be her second extended stay at a KFC restaurant this summer.

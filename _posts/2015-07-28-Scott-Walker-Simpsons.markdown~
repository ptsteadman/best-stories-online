Donald Trump has surprised the Republican establishment with his outrageous quips and unexpected rise to the top of the polls. However it is candidate Scott Walker (R-WI) who has stirred things up most recently with this bizarre quote about a long-running animated series.

“Many have long speculated that the quality of ‘The Simpsons’ has declined,” Walker said in a written statement released today.

“This is incorrect. ‘The Simpsons’ is still good.”

Reaction to this unexpected opinion has been mixed, with many potential voters expressing confusion. 
Others have not hesitated to make their vehement disagreement known, such as registered Iowa caucus participant Beverly Wittner.

“This guy wants to be the leader of the free world and he thinks ‘The Simpsons’ is still good?” asks the 57 year-old elementary school teacher and lifelong Des Moines resident. “‘The Simpsons’ isn’t good. It hasn’t been good in forever. Has he even watched the show in the past 15 years? I have to wonder. Because if he has, he would know it definitely isn’t good anymore.”

Representatives for Scott Walker responded to our requests for comment on this developing story with the following statement.

“Scott Walker stands by his claim that ‘The Simpsons’ is still good. He would like to elaborate on his previously stated position and clarify that not only is the show still ‘good’, its current quality is unrivaled by any other period in the show’s tenure. Seasons 3-9 were great, no one’s disputing that, but they do not compare to the incisive social commentary that marks the episodes of season 21 and beyond. Governor Walker strongly believes that not only is ‘The Simpsons’ still good, it is better than it has ever been.”

Beverly Wittner did not immediately respond to our requests for comment.

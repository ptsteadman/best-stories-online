Samantha Ross was preparing to have dinner with her fiancé and his parents when she received a text from her co-worker and friend Claire Castlewood that caused her extreme alarm. Castlewood had been passed over for a promotion earlier that week at the investment bank where they both worked and was also recently left by her fiancé, her college sweetheart who played lacrosse at their alma mater Cornell. The text, completely cryptic and composed in emoji, caused Ross to cancel her plans and head over to the Upper East Side apartment of her friend.

Ross found her friend unconscious on her Room and Board Eden Convertible Sleeper Sofa and Google Chrome opened on her Macbook Air to a [youtube video of a 2011 Fancy Feast commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VednEJhS1Og) in which a man converts his private space in his home to a room for a cat and presents a woman with a kitten wearing a tag reading 'will you marry us', asking her to move in with him and the kitten.

Ross quickly called law enforcement and paramedics arrived to resuscitate Castlewood, who had no history of mental health treatment. Yet, recently she started attending women in finance meetup groups and had shared with an anonymous source that she had felt passed over for a promotion. We also learned that the victim had recently lost her beloved cat to old age.

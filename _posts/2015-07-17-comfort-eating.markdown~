Amethyst Amelia Kelly, better known by her stage name Iggy Azalea, spent an
entire week in a KFC eating fried chicken wings after being dumped by her
fiancé, L.A. Lakers small forward Nick Young, because she ‘needed time to
think’.

The lovesick rapper, 25, from Sydney, Australia, went to the fast food chain in
search of some comfort food to get over the break-up.

But seven days later Azalea was still ordering chicken wings with a side of
extra large fries at the KFC near a train station by her home.

She even phoned in sick to work to stay at the restaurant. 

Azalea said: ‘I was walking around feeling miserable and decided to stop off at
the KFC at the train station.

'I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings.

'But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

'I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of
him. So I stayed.'

After a few days employees at the chicken shop began to worry about Azalea.

Worker Rodney Benson, 22, said: 'We work in shifts here and the restaurant is
open 24 hours a day, so we get a lot of people coming through.

'At first no one really noticed her.

'But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar.

'Then I realised we had been serving her for the past three days and that she
hadn’t actually left.

'When we asked her if she was ok, she said she was and just needed time to
think.

'And then asked for another box of chicken wings with extra large fries.’

He said the Azalea was doing no harm eating her way through boxes of chicken so
they let her stay.

He added: 'She was after all a paying customer, even if a bit of an odd one.'

Azalea decided she had had enough when local media turned up after a week at
the KFC. And, unsurprisingly, she was starting to get sick of the taste of
chicken. 

'I decided the best thing to do would be to leave the city and go back to my
parents.

'I had already told work I was off sick, so phoned them and said I was leaving.

'And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in
staying there anymore.'

She then boarded the next train to her parents' home in Vaucluse, in the
Sydney’s affluent Eastern Suburbs and left.

Waitress Donna Jimenez said: 'I guess we kind of miss her. It certainly made
work more interesting.'

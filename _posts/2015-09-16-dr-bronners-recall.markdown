Dr. Bronner's and his "Moral ABC" receive an "F" from FDA as tocopherol in a large batch of the flagship Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Pure-Castile Liquid Soap product is found to be derived from genetically modified, lab-grown plants. The affected products contain tocopherol that was extracted from soy grown in Canadian laboratories. 

Emanuel Bronner is the founder of the company and died in 1997.  He actually is not a doctor, but a German-born soapmaker bravely escaping Nazi Germany by emigrating to the United States in 1929. The packaging on Dr. Bronner's products features a long rant printed in tiny text elaborating a philosophy Bronner calls "All-One-God-Faith" that erratically blends many traditions. In 1947, while promoting his "Moral ABC" at a university in Chicago, Bronner was detained and sent to a mental hospital in Elgin, Illinois, from which he escaped after shock treatments. Until Bonner's death, the soap was produced in a small factory without any mechanical machinery. 

His family has since continued the business and claims to maintains the same values as the late Bronner. Yet, the manufacturing and ingredients sourcing has undergone transformation since Bonner's death.  Notably, not all of the ingredients are from the United States.

Trump has a complicated relationship with cycling.  In the early nineties, he sponsored the so-called "Tour de Trump", an American bike race that he claimed would soon be more popular than the storied "Tour de France".  Unfortunately for American fans, the "Tour de Trump" went bankrupt after just two years.

More recently, Trump has lambasted Secretary of State John Kerry for his public cycling obsession.  In June, Trump stated: "We won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal [with Iran], who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg.  I won't be doing that.  And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race.  That I can tell you."

Analysts say that participating in a SoulCycle class is a surprising move for Trump.  Some critics have already suggested that the decision echoes his "flip-flopping" on issues such as abortion and universal health care.

SoulCycle is an indoor cycling workout class where participants ride stationary bikes in cadence with 'the pack'.  It is often styled as a spiritual experience.  The expensive classes tend to attract high-performing, wealthy individuals, especially at the Financial District studio near the Trump Building at 40 Wall Street where "The Donald" and his wife were seen.

"He gave a good effort," Mrs. Selva told Best Stories Online.  "He wasn't going to let anyone see him quit."

But near the end of the class, Trump's positive outlook changed.  He began to loudly criticize the choice of Lana Del Rey's new single, "High by the Beach", as part of the workout's playlist.

"Who is this, Lana Del Rey?"  Trump reportedly said.  "She's been having a rough year.  She's totally useless."

According to sources at the scene, Trump stormed out of the studio before the end of the recommended "cool down" period.   His spouse Melania followed closely behind.  Some of Trump's fellow cyclists speculated that Melania may have pressured Trump to attend the class.

Lana Del Rey, the stage name of Elizabeth Grant, produces melodic pop music with sexually charged lyrics.  She was not available for comment on Trump's statement.

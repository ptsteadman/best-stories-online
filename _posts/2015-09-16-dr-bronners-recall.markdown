- __Tainted tocopherol: controversial ingredient flunks FDA screening__
- __Emanuel H. Bronner is not an actual doctor__
- __1,420,000 bottles of Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Liquid Soap subject to recall__

Dr. Bronner's and his "Moral ABC" receive an "F" from FDA as tainted tocopherol is found in a large batch of the flagship Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Pure-Castile Liquid Soap product. The affected products contain tocopherol that was extracted from genetically modified soy grown in Canadian laboratories.

Emanuel Bronner was the founder of the Dr. Bronner's Magical Soap Company and died in 1997.  Bronner wasn't actually a doctor, but a German-born soapmaker who emigrated to the United States in 1929. The packaging on Dr. Bronner's products features a long rant printed in tiny text elaborating a philosophy Bronner calls "All-One-God-Faith" that erratically blends many traditions.

In 1947, while promoting his "Moral ABC" at a university in Chicago, Bronner was detained and sent to a mental hospital in Elgin, Illinois, from which he escaped after shock treatments. Until Bonner's death, the soap was produced in a small factory without any mechanical machinery.

His family has since continued the business and claims to maintain the same values as the late Bronner. Yet, the soap's manufacturing and ingredient sourcing have undergone changes since Bonner's death.  Notably, not all of the ingredients are from the United States.  Canadian tocopherol derived from soy plants grown indoors at an Edmonton, Alberta facility had tested positive for lead at 6.76 ppm (parts per million). There is no safe level for lead and its presence especially problematic as Pure-Castile Liquid Soap is often used to wash dishes.

Dr. Bronner's customers can send their soap back to the Dr. Bronner's manufacturing facility at 751 N Citracado Pkwy, Escondido, CA 92029 for a full refund, shipping included.

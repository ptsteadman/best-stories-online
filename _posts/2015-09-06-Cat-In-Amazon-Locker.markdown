Small white cat was found inside an Amazon Locker in Sunnyside, Queens early this morning around 5:30 AM local time.  There is security footage with a timestamp dated approximentaly 10 hours prior showing the feline outside the locker. **Note:** the date is miscalibrated on the closed circuit television capture, but the time is accurate.

Alison Byrd was collecting a parcel from the Amazon Locker early Sunday morning and her barcode unlocked a door where a small white cat was sleeping.  Byrd commented, "I was pretty confused and horrified. I was just picking up some diapers I ordered with my Amazon Prime membership. I thought maybe I was mistakenly sent a lambswool duster or a boom microphone windscreen. The cat was very sweet after initially seeming very startled to be awoken."

7-11 employee, Wicktor Waschuk was on duty at the time Byrd encountered the white cat.  Washuck stated that "[he] had seen the white cat around the store in the past, but not for many months."

According to a [police blotter report](http://patch.com/illinois/evanston/police-fire) and social media posts, around
11AM on Monday morning several employees of a Evanston, IL cosmetics company
were spotted crawling down a busy local sidewalk.  Concerned onlookers
called the police, who stopped the group of crawling individuals and contacted
the management of the company.

A spokesperson for KMS cosmetics stated over the phone that the activity was a
voluntary "challenge exercise" aimed at reducing self-consciousness and
overcoming artificial limitations.

Law enforcement officers who responded to the call helped treat minor
abrasions to the hands and knees of some of the crawling employees.

One employee stressed that the activity was not a marketing stunt, but rather
part of an ongoing effort by the company to change the office culture.  She felt
that despite the value of many of the team building events, the crawling exercise
"went too far", and that she "felt pressured" to participate in the activity.

No charges have been pressed against the company, but police filed a written request 
requiring that KMS Cosmetics not repeat the exercise, citing the traffic hazard posed by the
crawling employees and the potential for injury.  The company has been harshly
criticized on social media for the possibly abusive training activity, but has
not yet made an official statement.

According the company website, [KMS Cosmetics](http://www.antonymcosmetics.com/), a brand of Antonym Beauty
Products, is building an online platform to sell high-quality "EcoLuxe" makeup
products.  The company was founded in 2012 and was recently featured in [Smart
Growth America's](http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/) list of the top 25 startups in Evanston.

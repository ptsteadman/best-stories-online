- __Weird Facebook is a subculture existing within normal facebook, consisting of pages, secret groups, and personalities__
- __Weird Facebook is made up of people without "real lives", or people that have built a normal life, but want more__
- __Facebook friendships are what's left when people grow out of being "alt/hipster"__

### Internet Subculture Diaspora

The past year has been rough for Internet subcultures.  Alt Lit finally fragmented into , Net Art continued its downward slide into the corporate art world, Hipster Runoff quietly died (for real this time), vaporwave stalled, Gamergate happened, Reddit suffered a series of embarassing scandals, and the founder of 4chan threw in the towel.

>The past year has been rough for Internet subcultures.

All of these subcultures are (or were) rooted in specific websites and brands: popserial.net, dump.fm, hipsterunoff, ello.co, rhizome.org, /b, Macintosh Plus, Feminist Frequency, Yung Lean.   The failure to create scalable and alternative institutions has meant that a lot of young people trying to build an identity are in retreat, along with the weird friends they made elsewhere on the Internet.   Recent trendpieces from [The Daily Dot]() and other sources have speculated that a lot of the Internet's weirdness is moving to generic mash of Facebook, where it exists in an uneasy limbo with the day-to-day posts of "normal" facebook users.

### Using Facebook Wrong

What is "Weird Facebook"?  According to [The Daily Dot](), Weird Facebook shouldn't exist, and has something to do with "meme pages".  Other people say that they ended up on Weird Facebook when they started adding friends from other online communities like LiveJournal, 4chan, and tumblr.  People agree that The loosely-defined community has been the subject at least one "trend piece", but is definitely still emergent.

Facebook was a product of Harvard, and has relied upon the faint remaining whiff of exclusivity and poise...above the ugliness and mess of the rest of the Internet...
reflects "real life" connections, connections with a quantifiable value, social capital or advertising

### Real Life and "Normies"

For many, Facebook has become the social network where "real life" happens.  It's where people announce their new achievements, relationships, marriages, and children.  But what if you don't have any of these things?  What if you don't have a "real life"?

>What if you don't have a "real life"?

"I guess I got into 'weird facebook' after I failed out of college and was living with my parents," said Lucas, the owner of a page dedicated to music memes.  "No one called it [weird facebook] at the time obviously, I had no idea what I was doing.  I added some  weird musicians and writers that I was into.   Eventually I added so many of these people that facebook started suggesting more of them, and I'd get a bunch of requests."

"This was like, four years ago?  Now I have hundreds of mutual friends with people who I've never met, and never will meet."w

"idk. i think i might trust ppl more on here because they got to know me in an envnt we both felt unthreatened in.

like maybe I relax or open up better here."

"i don't know. i kind of feel like it's a natural transition from being a heavy reader. more words to read.

it has always been a big comfort to me.

i was very into LiveJournal before this. they encouraged me."

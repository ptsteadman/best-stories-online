- __$175 a month memberships fees attract the rich, but not often the beautiful__
- __Equinox recruits attractive users of low-rent gyms such as Planet Fitness, Blink Fitness and Retro Fitness, offering discounted or free memberships__
- __Opinions about practice divided among paying clients__

A source has revealed an innovative growth practice by ultra-exclusive Equinox Fitness in New York City, with membership fees as high as $250 a month for access to all outposts. The gym actually offers discounted memberships to attractive men and women, often finding them in bargain chains such as Planet Fitness, Retro Fitness and a chain under their own parent company, Blink Fitness. "We actually opened up Blink as a part of our Equinox growth strategy, we thought it could be thought of as like a 'feeder gym' for us in this program" a former Equinox consultant told us under the condition of anonymity.

Our source explained that "Equinox hired a firm to scout and poach users of other gyms. The scouts were attractive and would just approach men and women that fit brand guidelines at other gyms and tell them they could work out at Equinox for what they pay at their current gyms." The brand guidelines include that male recruits must be between 8% and 10% body fat and females must be between 14% and 17%. An additional bounty was placed on recruits that had "the special sauce", like speaking with a British or Australian accent. The brand guidelines also stipulated that recruits should not have visible tattoos. 

The source elaborated "it makes a lot of sense: there are plenty of attractive people in [New York City] who have made choices that have left them with limited financial resources, we signed up a lot of aspiring actors and models for this program."

BSO found a benefactor of the discount program, Peter Carlyle, who explained to us that "I love Equinox, I was at Planet Fitness before. There were no classes at Planet Fitness. I've been encouraged to take classes here on a regular schedule because other members tend to attend them so they can see me. I have enjoyed learning yoga and a few of the women in my class are hot, but they might also be in the discount program. I'm not sure."  Carlyle was scouted at the Wall Street Planet Fitness and is an aspiring actor from the United Kingdom.

BSO spent some time outside the Wall Street Equinox and talked to a few members about what we learned from our sources. Maggie Liu, a financial analyst at JP Morgan Chase, was appalled

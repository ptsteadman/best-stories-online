Last night Kevin Campbell was found dead in an Echo Park apartment. Campbell is famous for tattooing Toronto-born Rapper Drake's name on the forehead of an unnamed woman in late 2011. After such, an argument erupted on Twitter between Drake--real name Aubrey Graham--and Campbell. Yet, the conflict was [reportedly resolved](http://www.spin.com/2012/01/drake-ends-beef-conscience-free-tattoo-artist/) in 2012.

Drake was reached for comment and said "Good f---- riddance, f--- that guy."  Drake reportedly had his body guard visit Campbell in 2011.  While Drake was in LA over the weekend and despite his comments, LAPD has not named the rapper as a suspect.

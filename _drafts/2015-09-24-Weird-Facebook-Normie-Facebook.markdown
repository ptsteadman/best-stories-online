### Facebook Is Really Uncool

At the beginning, Facebook was really exclusive.  You could only get in if you
were a student at Harvard, and this whiff of selectiveness helped set Facebook
apart from its primary competitor, MySpace.  Facebook was full of "real people", not
spam accounts, and had a clean, whitespace-heavy UI.  Friendships on Facebook
represented real-life relationships, worth some amount of social capital.

Now people love to joke about how literally everyone is on Facebook, thanks to
aggressive expansion by the company both in the United States and abroad.  At
the same time, Facebook has attempted to stay true to its past by ensuring that
Facebook accounts correspond to real people, and that Facebook friendships
correspond to real frienships.  In practice, this means that Facebook often
suspends the accounts of transgendered individuals who change their names, and
prevents people from making too many friend requests outside of their networks.

Most people agree that Facebook is pretty uncool.  It's your dad's social
network.  Therefore, it's surprising that many observers of the Internet,
including Dis Magazine, The New Yorker, and The Daily Dot have called Facebook
the next big thing for culture, art, and alternative life.  Dis Magazine
[recently
identified](http://dismagazine.com/discussion/29786/club-kids-the-social-life-of-artists-on-facebook/)
Facebook as "the dominant platform" for art and artists, and a
[piece](https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/facebook-ade/) in N+1
noted that the average Facebook profile has about the same amount of text and
literary value as the average novel.  According to Daily Dot, a more 'low-brow'
publication,  Weird Facebook is "inscrutable", and likened it to David Lynch and
Yung Lean "projecting their consciousnesses onto social media".

Why is all this weird art and meme stuff happening on Facebook?  The Daily Dot
noted that "Facebook is not the forum for this kind of shit at all." 

Weird facebook has emerged, a loose collection of pages, secret groups, and most
importantly, friendships and personalities.  

Why has this happened at Facebook, instead of some cooler, alternative site on
the internet?  The gen x dream.

Subcultures have tried to build their own institutions, often around custom
websites, businesses, or publications.  The Gen X dream.

`Despite this, Facebook continues to gain and retain users, even in the
teen demographic.  In a recent earnings call, Facebook CFO David Ebersman stated
the company was pleased to “remain close to fully penetrated among teens in the
U.S.”   Millenials are still on Facebook, too.  Often, all that remains of
college friendships or partnerships are Facebook connections.




### Internet Subculture Diaspora

The past year has been rough for Internet subcultures.  Alt Lit finally
fragmented into , Net Art continued its downward slide into the corporate art
world, Hipster Runoff quietly died (for real this time), vaporwave stalled,
Gamergate happened, Reddit suffered a series of embarassing scandals, and the
founder of 4chan threw in the towel.

All of these subcultures are (or were) rooted in specific websites and brands: popserial.net, dump.fm, hipsterunoff, ello.co, rhizome.org, /b, Macintosh Plus, Feminist Frequency, Yung Lean.   The failure to create scalable and alternative institutions has meant that a lot of young people trying to build an identity are in retreat, along with the weird friends they made elsewhere on the Internet.   Recent trendpieces from [The Daily Dot]() and other sources have speculated that a lot of the Internet's weirdness is moving to generic mash of Facebook, where it exists in an uneasy limbo with the day-to-day posts of "normal" facebook users.

### Using Facebook Wrong

What is "Weird Facebook"?  According to [The Daily Dot](), Weird Facebook shouldn't exist, and has something to do with "meme pages".  Other people say that they ended up on Weird Facebook when they started adding friends from other online communities like LiveJournal, 4chan, and tumblr.  People agree that The loosely-defined community has been the subject at least one "trend piece", but is definitely still emergent.

Facebook was a product of Harvard, and has relied upon the faint remaining whiff of exclusivity and poise...above the ugliness and mess of the rest of the Internet...
reflects "real life" connections, connections with a quantifiable value, social capital or advertising

### Real Life and "Normies"

For many, Facebook has become the social network where "real life" happens.  It's where people announce their new achievements, relationships, marriages, and children.  But what if you don't have any of these things?  What if you don't have a "real life"?

>What if you don't have a "real life"?

"I guess I got into 'weird facebook' after I failed out of college and was living with my parents," said Lucas, the owner of a page dedicated to music memes.  "No one called it [weird facebook] at the time obviously, I had no idea what I was doing.  I added some  weird musicians and writers that I was into.   Eventually I added so many of these people that facebook started suggesting more of them, and I'd get a bunch of requests."

"This was like, four years ago?  Now I have hundreds of mutual friends with people who I've never met, and never will meet."w

"idk. i think i might trust ppl more on here because they got to know me in an envnt we both felt unthreatened in.

like maybe I relax or open up better here."

"i don't know. i kind of feel like it's a natural transition from being a heavy reader. more words to read.

it has always been a big comfort to me.

i was very into LiveJournal before this. they encouraged me."

text-oriented

edgy
humor
unscalable within a scalable system

### The Anatomy of Weird Facebook 

1. Pages

2. Groups

3. Statuses and Personalities

It's hard to point at any one thing that is Weird Facebook.  There's no one page
or person that defines weird facebook.  This is part of what makes weird
facebook strong.  Weird Facebook is an emergent property of a certain network of
people, not an aesthetic that someone came up with to push their own artistic
agenda.  The networked nature of Weird Facebook is what will allow it to scale,
and allow it to survive scandal or changing fashions.  Weird Facebooks is as
ineradicable as real life.

Our article of September 17, 2015 regarding Dr. Bronner's soap
contained claims that are __inaccurate__ and __false__.

We have removed the article immediately at the request of Dr. Bronner’s legal counsel.

The article asserted that Dr. Bronner’s Peppermint Pure-Castile Liquid soap
'contain[s] tocopherol that was extracted from genetically modified soy grown in
Canadian laboratories.'  In fact, the tocopherol in this product is derived from natural,
non-genetically modified sunflower oil from Spain, and is extracted naturally without
synthetic solvents, and has not been irradiated or treated with toxic waste and sewage
sludge. Thus the statement made in the article about the origin and nature of the
tocopherol was absolutely, unequivocally false.

There has never been any issue, question or concern raised by the Food and Drug Administration about the tocopherol in any Dr. Bronner’s product and no recall of any kind of Dr. Bronner’s Peppermint Pure-Castile Liquid Soap. 

The article also contained inaccuracies regarding the life of Dr. Emmanuel Bronner, and the history of the company that he founded.

The photograph of indoor growing facility included with the original article was not of a Dr. Bronner's supplier.  Likewise,
the photograph of a home chemical laboratory was not a Dr. Bronner's manufacturing facility. 

All One God Faith, Inc. d/b/a Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soaps is a leading brand in the market for certified organic and made with organic personal care products, which are prized by consumers because of the assurance of the nature of the ingredients, and the absence of artificial and synthetic ingredients. We recognize the importance of this organic soap and deeply regret any harm our article may have caused.  Sorry!

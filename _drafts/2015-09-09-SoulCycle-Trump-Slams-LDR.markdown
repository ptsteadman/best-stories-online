Real Estate mogul Donald Trump defied expectations yet again when he showed up for a grueling 8:10AM SoulCycle session in lower Manhattan.  Trump sweated along with his wife and about 15 fitness-conscious New Yorkers.

"I go there almost every morning to get an inspiring start to my day, and suddenly today Trump was there with his wife," said Allison Selva, a financial analyst at Morgan Stanley.  "I'd recognize that hair and those mannerisms anywhere, you know?"

Trump has a complicated relationship with cycling.  In the early nineties, he sponsored the "Tour de Trump", a bike race down the eastern seaboard that he claimed would soon be more popular than the storied "Tour de France".  Unfortunately for American cyclists, the "Tour de Trump" went bankrupt after just two years.

More recently, Trump has crticized Secretary of State John Kerry for his public cycling obsession.  In June, he was quoted saying: "I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. And we won’t be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who’s making a horrible and laughable deal, who’s just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg. I won’t be doing that. And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you."

But for some reason, the morning after a trip to Washington where he attached the Iran deal yet again, Trump apparently decided to tag along to for a class at the exclusive cycling studio.


"He gave a good effort," Mrs. Selva told Best Stories Online.  "He wasn't going to let anyone see him quit."

But near the end of the class, Trump's positive outlook changed.  He began to loudly criticize the choice of Lana Del Rey's new single, "High by the Beach", as the final song for the workout's playlist.

"Who is this, Lana Del Rey?"  Trump reportedly said.  "She's been having a rough year.  She's totally useless."

Jared Fogle, notorious submarine sandwich enthusiast and [co-star of the 2011 Adam Sandler film Jack and Jill](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1815678/), was recently arrested on child pornography charges at his home in Indiana.

“Sure, we share a first name. Anyone can see that,” Leto told paparazzi who happened to catch him exiting an oxygen bar in downtown Los Angeles yesterday evening. “I’m invested in examining who Jared Fogle really is. Really getting deep down inside his psyche and bringing his true self to life---angels, demons and all.”

When asked about the circumstances surrounding Fogle’s downfall, Leto admitted the situation is complex. “It’s certainly challenging,” Leto acknowledged. “Here you have a guy who has everything and he just throws it all away. What would compel a man to do such a thing?”

Leto urged viewers to withhold judgment before they saw his performance. “It’s a cliche, but life really is a highway. And if I didn’t have every intention of riding it all night long, I wouldn’t be in this game. I’d go back to my hometown in Indiana and start my own Subway franchise. I’ve got the money, I’ve got the awards. I don’t need to do it for the fame. I’m in it for the glory. Artists are the chosen few of us who push the boundaries of our collective consciousness by taking bold risks and seemingly impossible challenges.”

“No one else was going to take this role,” Leto added from the driver’s seat before ending the impromptu press conference. 

“I’m going to make it shine.”

Most contemporary EDM is about achieving a dark euphoria, living the elusive
dream of being young, attractive, and privileged.  It's more motivational than
happy, suited to late nights at the office or working out at the gym.

Nightcore comes from a happier place: the 90s.  Because Nightcore is not as cool
as EDM.  

EDM/dubstep was made poppy.
Nightcore took pop music and made it "core".

Not the Ibiza style club that you will never go to.

As the primary elections approach, pollsters have uncovered striking differences
between the younger and older age cohorts within the Millennial generation. 

A young Millennial 

An older Millennial



Critiques of older Millennials are often gender-specific.  Terms like like 'bro'
and 'manchild' have emerged to describe underachieving Millennial men.  These
terms target the supposed inability of Millennial men to uphold American
standards of masculinity and independence.  More recently, new media
professionals like Gaby Dunn (b. 1988) and Alan Henson (b.  1988) have
popularized words like "fuckboy" and "softboy", which are focused on men who use
privilege and manipulation to extract sexual Millennial male "gold diggers".

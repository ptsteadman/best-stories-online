###Careers at Select Star Media Group

We proudly offer our full-time US employees a robust benefits offering,
including:

__Fully paid medical insurance__

For employees in our New York Office, we cover 100% of the premiums for our
standard level of medical insurance plan, including coverage for domestic
partners, spouses, and families. Outside of New York, we cover the great
majority of coverage for all groups.

Life insurance and short/long term disability insurance is 100% covered by
Gawker. Employees can choose to purchase dental, vision or supplemental
life/disability insurance.

__Time off when you need it — and a sabbatical after four years.__

PTO, Personal Day, Sick Days? Doesn't matter: we don't formally track time off —
take time off when you need it in consultation with your Manager.

After four years of continuous employment, employees are eligible for a
sabbatical — one month paid time off, in addition to whatever time off you'd
otherwise take that year.

__401k with 3% contribution__

We'll help you save for the future with a 401k plan. And after one year, we'll
contribute 3% of your entire compensation, on top of any contributions you make.

__Brand new gorgeous Bushwick office with weekly breakfast and lunch and
regular staff events__

We provide breakfast and lunch to all staff in the New York office once a week. 

__Stay Healthy__

We’ll help you stay healthy by subsidizing a significant amount of your Equinox
or New York Sports Club membership. Not a member of Equinox or NYSC? We’ll
reimburse you up to $50 per month for a gym or yoga studio of your choice.

__Cell Phone Reimbursement__

We reimburse every employee for their cell phone plan, up to $80 per month. 

__Commuter Benefits Program__

Have money deducted directly from your pay check on a pre-tax basis (saving you
25% to 40%, depending on your tax rate), which you can use for public transit
and parking costs.

__Referral Bonus__

Many of our best employees come from referrals. Refer a friend to an open
position and get $1,500 after 90 days.
